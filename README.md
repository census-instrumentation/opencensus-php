# OpenCensus for PHP - A stats collection and distributed tracing framework

> [Census][census-org] for PHP. Census provides a framework to measure a
server's resource usage and collect performance stats. This repository contains
PHP related utilities and supporting software needed by Census.

* [Integration Documentation][integration-docs]

## Installation & basic usage

1. Install the `opencensus/opencensus` package using [composer][composer]:

    ```bash
    $ composer require opencensus/opencensus:~0.2
    ```

    **IMPORTANT: Please ensure your version is >= 0.2.0**. There is a potential security
    vulnerability in < 0.2.0.

1. [Optional]: Install the `opencensus` extension from [PECL][pecl]:

    ```bash
    $ pecl install opencensus-alpha
    ```
   Enable the extension in your `php.ini`:

    ```ini
    extension=opencensus.so
    ```

1. Initialize a tracer for your application:

    ```php
    use OpenCensus\Trace\Tracer;
    use OpenCensus\Trace\Exporter\EchoExporter;

    Tracer::start(new EchoExporter());
    ```

## Usage

To add tracing to a block of code, you can use the closure/callable form or
explicitly open and close spans yourself.

### Closure/Callable (preferred)

```php
$pi = Tracer::inSpan(['name' => 'expensive-operation'], function() {
    // some expensive operation
    return calculatePi(1000);
});

$pi = Tracer::inSpan(['name' => 'expensive-operation'], 'calculatePi', [1000]);
```

### Explicit Span Management

```php
// Creates a detached span
$span = Tracer::startSpan(['name' => 'expensive-operation']);

// Opens a scope that attaches the span to the current context
$scope = Tracer::withSpan($span);
try {
    $pi = calculatePi(1000);
} finally {
    // Closes the scope (ends the span)
    $scope->close();
}
```

## Customization

### Samplers

You can specify different samplers when initializing a tracer. The default
sampler is the `AlwaysSampleSampler` which will attempt to trace all requests.

The provided samplers are:

| Class | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| [NeverSampleSampler][never-sampler] | Never trace any requests |
| [AlwaysSampleSampler][always-sampler] | Trace all requests |
| [MultiSampler][multi-sampler] | Check multiple samplers |
| [QpsSampler][qps-sampler] | Trace X requests per second. Requires a PSR-6 cache implementation |
| [ProbabilitySampler][probability-sampler] | Trace X percent of requests. |

If you would like to provide your own sampler, create a class that implements
`SamplerInterface`.

### Exporters

You can choose different exporters to send the collected traces to.

The provided exporters are:

| Class | Description | Dependency |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------- |
| [EchoExporter][echo-exporter] | Output the collected spans to stdout | |
| [FileExporter][file-exporter] | Output JSON encoded spans to a file | |
| [JaegerExporter][jaeger-exporter] | Report traces to Jaeger server via Thrift over UDP | [opencensus/opencensus-exporter-jaeger][jaeger-packagist] |
| [LoggerExporter][logger-exporter] | Exporter JSON encoded spans to a PSR-3 logger | |
| [NullExporter][null-exporter] | No-op | |
| [OneLineEchoExporter][one-line-echo-exporter] | Output the collected spans to stdout with one-line | |
| [StackdriverExporter][stackdriver-exporter] | Report traces to Google Cloud Stackdriver Trace | [opencensus/opencensus-exporter-stackdriver][stackdriver-packagist] |
| [ZipkinExporter][zipkin-exporter] | Report collected spans to a Zipkin server | [opencensus/opencensus-exporter-zipkin][zipkin-packagist] |

If you would like to provide your own reporter, create a class that implements
`ExporterInterface`.
